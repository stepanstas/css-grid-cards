# css-grid-cards

This is a collection of CSS styles applied to HTML elements that creates a responsive grid of cards, each card featuring a header, an image, and information about the content. The HTML is styled with Arial, Helvetica, or sans-serif font and has a minimum height of 100vh. The body is centered both vertically and horizontally and has a maximum width of 1000px. The card grid has adjustable columns with a minimum of 200px and a gap of 1rem between each card. The card itself has an adjustable height with a hidden overflow. The card's information section is text-aligned to center and has a specified font size and weight. The footer of each card is a flex-box column with a colored background and white text, featuring a link with a hover effect.
